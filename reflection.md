1.what does the code do?
fetchquestion grabs 10 questions from the API and calls the displayquestion to render the questions. The display question function dynamically creates the HTML elements for each question, it also clears all old questions that was previously displayed and appends the new questions/answers to the container. HandleFormSubmit checks for existing usrenames using cookies, calculates the users score with calculateScore function, and saves the score with saveScore function.

2.Coding process?
tried to go step by step with each branch. If at one point I dont understand whats going on completely go to the next branch as this would refresh my thinking process and comeback to it in the bug-fixing branch, ask my peers for advice and give me a step in the right direction.

3.Challenges did i have
how to approach each step in the branch as it was pretty bare bones instructions in the assignment so how you go about it can vary and I easily got lost on the coding process without the help of my peers yuan and raven.

4.What would i do differently
take advantage of tutors as the material will only get harder from here
